# MY HOMEWORK IS IN THIS FILE

def check(str1,str2):
    if(sorted(str1)== sorted(str2)):
        print("True")
    else:
        print("False")

str1 = "rats"
str2 = "star"
check(str1, str2)


first, i created a function called check and inside i have my two strings. 
second, i did a if statement that states if both of my strings are the same, it will print True.
And if they are not the same, it will print false.
Lastly, i named my two strings, that i got from canvas, and called the function.
